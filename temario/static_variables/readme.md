# Class or Static Variables in Python
In Python, a static variable is a variable that is shared among all instances of a class, rather than being unique to each instance. It is also sometimes referred to as a class variable, because it belongs to the class itself rather than any particular instance of the class.

Static variables are defined inside the class definition, but outside of any method definitions. They are typically initialized with a value, just like an instance variable, but they can be accessed and modified through the class itself, rather than through an instance.

## Features of Static Variables
Static variables are allocated memory once when the object for the class is created for the first time.
Static variables are created outside of methods but inside a class
Static variables can be accessed through a class but not directly with an instance.
Static variables behavior doesn’t change for every object.
The Python approach is simple; it doesn’t require a static keyword. 

Note: All variables which are assigned a value in the class declaration are class variables. And variables that are assigned values inside methods are instance variables.
